#To slot a new ECG-like dataset into this pipeline, mirror how the built-in ECGQACoTQADataset (or ECGQADataset) works:
#Create a Dataset Loader – Write a loader module alongside ecgqa_loader.py. It should 1) download/expose your raw signals and metadata, 2) ensure every example knows where its waveform lives, and 3) return Hugging Face Dataset objects per split with the same keys (ecg_paths, clinical_contexts, question, answer, etc.). Re-using their caching/downloading utilities keeps structure consistent.
#Implement a QADataset subclass – Copy ECGQACoTQADataset to, say, MyDatasetQACoTQADataset, tweaked for your schema. Keep the overrides: _load_splits (call your loader), _get_pre_prompt/_get_post_prompt, _get_answer, and _get_text_time_series_prompt_list (the crucial part that reads WFDB/CSV/whatever, downsamples, normalizes, and packs TextTimeSeriesPrompt objects). Leave the rest so QADataset can format batches into the prompt dictionaries used by training.
#Add dataset exports – Update __init__.py to expose your new class, and if you need CLI helpers, mirror the small utilities in __init__.py.
#Wire a curriculum stage – In curriculum_learning.py, add a stage function similar to stage5_ecg_cot, but pointing to your dataset class. Decide hyperparameters (epochs, learning rates). Add the stage ID to CURRICULUM_STAGES if you want it in the default sequence.
#Configure loading paths – Ensure time_series_datasets/constants.py (or equivalent) knows where your raw data lives. Follow how RAW_DATA is used for PTB-XL.
#Validate components – Before full training, run your dataset module standalone (like python -m time_series_datasets.my_dataset.my_loader) to confirm splits, and instantiate a single batch in a notebook to check TextTimeSeriesPrompt outputs. Then run curriculum_learning.py --stage my_stage --eval-only to spot format issues early.
#Document and automate – Add instructions in README.md or a new file describing how to fetch your data, any licenses, and training commands.
#Once these pieces mirror the existing pipeline, your data will flow through PromptWithAnswer → extend_time_series_to_match_patch_size_and_aggregate → Flamingo without further changes. Natural next steps: build the loader skeleton and dataset subclass, test them with a tiny sample, then integrate the curriculum stage.
