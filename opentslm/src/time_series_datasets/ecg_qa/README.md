# ECG Question-Answering Dataset

ECG-QA is one of the core training datasets for **OpenTSLM**, providing comprehensive question-answering capabilities for electrocardiogram analysis. This dataset combines ECG time series data from PTB-XL with diverse medical questions, enabling text-time series LLMs to perform clinical ECG interpretation.

## Dataset Overview

ECG-QA contains single-ECG and multi-ECG questions. Multi-ECG questions are about comparing two ECGs. The latter are not used for training OpenTSLM.

### Full Dataset (All Question Types)

| Split          | Samples     | Description                                  |
| -------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Train**      | 267,539     | Training samples for model learning          |
| **Validation** | 64,663      | Validation samples for hyperparameter tuning |
| **Test**       | 82,146      | Test samples for final evaluation            |
| **Total**      | **414,348** | Complete ECG question-answering dataset      |

### Filtered Dataset (Single Questions Only, `exclude_comparison=True`)

| Split          | Samples     | Removed     | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Train**      | 159,306     | 108,233     | Single-question training samples                |
| **Validation** | 31,137      | 33,526      | Single-question validation samples              |
| **Test**       | 41,093      | 41,053      | Single-question test samples                    |
| **Total**      | **231,536** | **182,812** | Filtered dataset excluding comparison questions |

**Note:** The filtered dataset excludes all comparison questions (those requiring analysis of multiple ECGs).

## Example ECG Analysis

![ECG Example](ecg_example_real.png)

**Clinical Context:** 76-year-old male patient. 12-lead ECG clinical recording. Signal quality: baseline drift noted, static noise present, burst noise present, electrode artifacts present. Extra beats detected during recording. Pacemaker present.

**Question:** Does this ECG show symptoms of non-diagnostic t abnormalities?

**Expected Answer:** yes

This example demonstrates how OpenTSLM processes ECG signals on a millimeter paper grid (similar to clinical practice) and answers specific diagnostic questions about cardiac conditions.

### Relationship to PTB-XL

ECG-QA leverages the **PTB-XL dataset** (21,799 unique ECG recordings) by creating **multiple medical questions per ECG**:

- **Base Dataset**: PTB-XL contains 21,799 clinical 12-lead ECG recordings
- **Question Multiplication**: Each ECG receives ~19 different diagnostic questions on average
- **Result**: 414,348 question-answer pairs from systematic medical questioning
- **Coverage**: Questions span rhythm analysis, morphology detection, and pathology identification

This approach mirrors real clinical practice where cardiologists ask multiple diagnostic questions about each ECG recording.

## Example Prompt

Here's how ECG-QA data appears when processed through the OpenTSLM pipeline:

```
=== PRE-PROMPT ===
You are an expert cardiologist analyzing an ECG (electrocardiogram).

Clinical Context: 76-year-old male patient. 12-lead ECG clinical recording.
Signal quality: baseline drift noted, static noise present. Extra beats detected
during recording. Pacemaker present.

Your task is to examine the ECG signal and answer a specific medical question about it.

=== QUESTION ===
Does this ECG show symptoms of non-diagnostic t abnormalities?

=== ECG SIGNAL DATA ===
ECG Lead I - sampled at ~100Hz, normalized (mean=0.003, std=0.132)
[Time series data: 1000 samples over 10 seconds]

ECG Lead II - sampled at ~100Hz, normalized (mean=-0.001, std=0.359)
[Time series data: 1000 samples over 10 seconds]

... (6 total ECG leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF)

=== POST-PROMPT ===
Based on your analysis of the ECG data, select your answer from the following options:
yes, no, not sure

Provide a brief explanation of your reasoning, then end your response with:
Answer: <your_answer>

=== EXPECTED ANSWER ===
yes
```

## Quick Start

```python
from time_series_datasets.ecg_qa.ECGQADataset import ECGQADataset

# Load ECG-QA splits (auto-downloads ~6GB of data on first run)
train_dataset = ECGQADataset(split="train", EOS_TOKEN="")
val_dataset = ECGQADataset(split="validation", EOS_TOKEN="")
test_dataset = ECGQADataset(split="test", EOS_TOKEN="")

print(f"Full dataset - Train: {len(train_dataset):,} samples")
print(f"Full dataset - Validation: {len(val_dataset):,} samples")
print(f"Full dataset - Test: {len(test_dataset):,} samples")

# Load filtered dataset (single questions only, excludes comparison questions)
train_filtered = ECGQADataset(split="train", EOS_TOKEN="", exclude_comparison=True)
val_filtered = ECGQADataset(split="validation", EOS_TOKEN="", exclude_comparison=True)
test_filtered = ECGQADataset(split="test", EOS_TOKEN="", exclude_comparison=True)

print(f"Filtered dataset - Train: {len(train_filtered):,} samples")
print(f"Filtered dataset - Validation: {len(val_filtered):,} samples")
print(f"Filtered dataset - Test: {len(test_filtered):,} samples")

# Examine a sample
sample = train_dataset[0]
print(f"Pre-prompt: {sample['pre_prompt'][:100]}...")
print(f"Answer: {sample['answer']}")
print(f"Question type: {sample['question_type']}")
print(f"Template ID: {sample['template_id']}")
print(f"ECG leads: {len(sample['time_series_text'])}")
```

## Data Structure
