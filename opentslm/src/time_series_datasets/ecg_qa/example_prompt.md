## Example ECG Analysis

**Clinical Context:** 76-year-old male patient. 12-lead ECG. clinical recording. recorded with AT-6 6. Signal quality: baseline drift noted, static noise present, burst noise present, electrode artifacts present. extra beats detected during recording. pacemaker present.

**Question:** Does this ECG show symptoms of non-diagnostic t abnormalities?

**Expected Answer:** yes

This example demonstrates how OpenTSLM processes ECG signals on a millimeter paper grid (similar to clinical practice) and answers specific diagnostic questions about cardiac conditions.
